## 📄 Project Statement

The **Tax Calculator Program** is a Python-based application designed to compute income tax based on predefined tax slabs. The primary objective of this project is to demonstrate the use of conditional statements, functions, and logical flow in Python. Users can enter their annual income, and the program will automatically calculate the total tax payable by checking the income against multiple slab conditions.

This project is ideal for beginners learning Python as it showcases basic programming concepts such as:

- User input handling
- Conditional branching (`if` statements)
- Mathematical operations
- Function creation and usage

The program provides a clear understanding of how income tax systems can be structured and implemented through code.
